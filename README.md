# Developer → Business Leader → AI-Powered Entrepreneur

## 🔄 My Journey
Started coding young, pivoted to business, returned when AI changed everything.

## 🧠 Unique Advantage
I speak both languages - **boardroom strategy** AND **production code**. This rare combination lets me build AI solutions that actually solve business problems, not just technical ones.

## 🚀 What I Bring
- Business acumen + technical execution
- 10+ years combined business/development experience
- Deep understanding of both strategic vision and implementation reality

## 🤝 Open to Collaboration
Looking for partnerships where business vision meets AI innovation.
